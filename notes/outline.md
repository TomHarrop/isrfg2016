## Rice inflorescence structure

## Inflorescence development & meristem transitions

## Aims: describe the regulatory processes controlling inflorescence development

* describe landscape of gene expression
* model the dynamics of the interactions between genes
* test the network e.g. with mutants

## Laser microdissection

## Clusters

## G1L genes

## G1L targets

## Evolution of G1L genes

## Uses for the data

* tell people to download the data for their favourite genes
* work with unknown genes too!
* model gene regulatory network
* correlate expression data with regulatory motifs
* combine with GWAS results in the literature (do a quick z-score analysis)
